🐱🐶 Cat vs Dog Classification

This project implements a deep learning model to classify images of cats and dogs. The model is trained using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and tested on a labeled dataset.

📌 Project Overview

Build a binary classification model for cats and dogs.

Preprocess image dataset (resizing, normalization, augmentation).

Train and evaluate a CNN model.

Visualize performance using accuracy and loss curves.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used is the Cats vs Dogs dataset from Kaggle:

Training images: 25,000 (12,500 cats, 12,500 dogs)

Labels: Binary (0 = Cat, 1 = Dog)
